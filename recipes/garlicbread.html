        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lomo Saltado is a Peruvian stir fry dish that's easy to make with few steps and ingredients. It can also be made with chicken (pollo saltado), but in this recipe, we're using beef (lomo)</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <uo>
            <li>- 16 ounces of frozen French fries</li>
            <li>- 1 pound beef (flank steak, skirt steak), sliced about 1/4" thin</li>
            <li>- Half a clove of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>- 1 medium red onion, sliced</li>
            <li>- 3 large tomatoes, peeled, sliced, and seeded</li>
            <li>- 1 yellow chili pepper (aji amarillo chili or paste if possible)</li>
            <li>- Oil, for cooking</li>
            <li>- Soy sauce</li>
            <li>- Salt</li>
            <li>- 2 tablespoons chopped freshed parsley (for topping)</li>
        </uo>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>FRENCH FRIES PREP:</strong> Following the instructions for your package of french fries, prepare them so that they're light golden, usually about 25 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>BEEF PREP:</strong> In a separate bowl, marinate the sliced beef with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and half of the garlic. Set aside for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>COOKING:</strong> In a frying pan or wok, add about 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Add in the marinated beef and cook until about medium-rare, then remove beef from the pan and set aside. Add a bit more oil if necessary, then add the onions and cook until slightly translucent. Stir in the tomatoes, chili, and remaining garlic. Add a tablespoon of soy sauce. Once tomatoes are a bit softened, add the beef back in with cooked french fries. Stir and fry for about another 2-3 minutes, or until beef at desired wellness. Season with salt to taste. Turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>SERVING:</strong> On an individual plate, add a bowl or scoop of rice with a side of the lomo saltado. Top the lomo saltado with chopped parsley. Enjoy.</li>
